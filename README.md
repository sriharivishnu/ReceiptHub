# ReceiptHub

This project was submitted to EngHack 2021

ReceiptHub is an app that uses NFC technology to efficiently scan and store your receipts. After doing so, it also lets users track their spending, and run analytics on the data as well. It seems strange that in a digital age, we are still relying on paper receipts for our returns, and our payment history. ReceiptHub aims to change that and bring receipts to the digital age.

Using a Raspberry Pi, we emulate a dynamic NFC tag to allow the phone to read its data. Since the reader device never reads data from the phone, the process is secured and it is up to the phone + app to send it to the cloud under the user's account. 

### Components
- Flutter App (written in Dart)
- Raspberry Pi Python Script (For reading/emulating NFC tags)
